 Excited to share my recent Machine Learning project where I successfully predicted diabetes using supervised learning techniques! ðŸš€

To start, I imported essential libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and loaded the dataset using pandas. Performing basic data analytics with pandas allowed me to understand the dataset better, and I made a copy of the dataset for future reference using the df.copy() function.

In the data cleaning phase, I replaced 0 values in variables with NaN to handle missing data appropriately. To fill these NaN values accurately, I first examined the data distribution using histograms. Depending on the distribution, I replaced the NaN values with mean, median, or mode. I also checked for outliers using box plots to ensure data integrity.

For model building, I used the scikit-learn library, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. I applied various machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and SVC. After training the models, I checked the accuracy of each model through cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

One of the key learnings from this project was understanding the different classifiers and their applications in predicting diabetes. Finally, I prepared a user interface using the pickle library and developed it into a deployable app using Streamlit. This app provides a seamless user experience for predicting diabetes.

Stay tuned for more insights and detailed breakdowns of each phase of this exciting journey!
